      question: "Q1: How does it work?",
      answer: "Inhaling on the diffuser will turn the inside liquids (melatonin, lavender, chamomile) into a light mist which you inhale, and then exhale out your nose. Inhaling the melatonin allows for a near-instant effect, and also allows you to experience the soothing aromatherapeutic effect of lavender and chamomile."
    },
    {
      question: "Q2: Is it safe to use every night?",
      answer: "Yes, the diffuser is made from 100% drug-free, plant-based ingredients, making it safe for nightly use."
    },
    {
      question: "Q3: How long does one refill last?",
      answer: "A single refill typically lasts about 30 uses, depending on the duration and frequency of each session."
    },
    {
      question: "Q4: Can I use it while traveling?",
      answer: "Absolutely! The compact design makes it easy to carry in your bag, so you can use it anywhere."
    },
    {
      question: "Q5: Are there any side effects?",
      answer: "There are no known side effects, as our ingredients are natural and plant-based. However, if you have specific allergies, please consult a doctor."
    },
    {
      question: "Q6: How should I clean the diffuser?",
      answer: "To clean the diffuser, simply wipe it down with a soft, damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials."
    },
    {
      question: "Q7: What if I don't like the scent?",
      answer: "We recommend trying it out in a small area first. If you still donâ€™t like it, we offer a satisfaction guarantee for returns."
    },
    {
      question: "Q8: Can I mix different scents?",
      answer: "Yes, you can mix different essential oils to create a custom blend. However, we recommend starting with one scent to understand its effects."
